# Personalized Customer Experience in Airlines Using Machine Learning 

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Machine Learning** to enhance **personalized customer experiences in the airline industry**. By leveraging customer data, airlines can predict passenger preferences and offer tailored services such as **personalized seat selection, meal preferences, and entertainment recommendations**. 

The project utilizes **K-Means Clustering** for customer segmentation and **Random Forest Classification** to predict passenger satisfaction, aiming to improve customer loyalty and maximize ancillary revenue.

## Objectives
-  **Enhance customer satisfaction** through personalized recommendations.
-  **Increase customer retention & loyalty** by offering tailored services.
-  **Optimize operational efficiency** through data-driven decision-making.
-  **Boost airline revenue** via targeted upselling opportunities.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection** 
   - Utilized the **Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset** from Kaggle.
   - Includes **25,000+ records** with passenger demographics, travel history, service ratings, and delays.

2. **Data Preprocessing** 
   - Handling missing values, normalization, and categorical encoding.
   - Feature selection based on **service ratings, travel type, and delays**.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 
   - Identified key **pain points affecting passenger satisfaction**.
   - Business travelers reported **higher ratings**, while economy-class travelers had **concerns over comfort & delays**.

4. **Machine Learning Models** 
   - **K-Means Clustering** : Segmented passengers into 3 distinct clusters:
     - **Business Travelers** (high-value customers)
     - **Economy-Class Passengers** (price-sensitive customers)
     - **Moderate Travelers** (seeking a balance between cost & comfort)
   - **Random Forest Classification** : Predicted passenger satisfaction with **95% accuracy**.

5. **A/B Testing for Personalization** 
   - Group A (personalized recommendations) had **84.7% satisfaction**.
   - Group B (non-personalized experience) had **63.0% satisfaction**.
   - A **21.7% improvement** in customer satisfaction was observed.

## Technologies Used 
- **Python** 
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development Environment)
- **Tableau** (Visualization & Dashboarding)

## Results 
**Identified key factors affecting passenger satisfaction**.  
**Improved satisfaction rates by 21.7% through personalization**.  
**Increased revenue potential through strategic upselling**.  
**Provided a scalable framework for airline customer experience enhancement**.
